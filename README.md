# Find and extract specific data from the HTML
# For example, find all the links on the page and print their href values

# Find and extract other data as needed using BeautifulSoup's methods and properties

This code uses the requests library to send a GET request to the specified website. It then creates a BeautifulSoup object by parsing the HTML content of the response. You can use various methods and properties provided by BeautifulSoup to find and extract specific data from the HTML structure.

In the example, it finds all the <a> tags on the page and prints their href values. You can modify the code to suit your specific scraping needs by exploring the BeautifulSoup documentation (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

Note that when scraping websites, it's important to review and respect the website's terms of service and policies. Additionally, some websites may have measures in place to prevent or restrict scraping, so ensure that your scraping activities comply with legal and ethical
